# Hessian Engineering for Atomistic Relaxation Optimization (***"HERO"***)

***HERO***   
is a toolkit to accelerate DFT structural optimization by tuning the Hessian information in the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method.   

This toolkit can accelerate DFT-based structural optimization by reducing the number of force calls, and meanwhile, it maintains a DFT-level accuracy.
